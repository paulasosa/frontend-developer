Hello and welcome to this branch!

This is the deal.

All days for the next 100 days I going to take one hour to programming something, interesting or not, we gonna see.
Also I go to practice my english, starting with the commits and all the things I go to writing in this file.

Starting day: 7 of April 2022.

Day 1. 
- First open all the files like .gitignore, readme, index1, with gir bash, do the commits and push to github!.

Good day!
