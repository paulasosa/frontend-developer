Hello and welcome to this branch!

This is the deal.

All days for the next 100 days I going to take one hour to programming something, interesting or not, we gonna see.
Also I go to practice my english, starting with the commits and all the things I go to writing in this file.

Starting day: 7 of April 2022.

Day 1. (7 of April 2022)
- First open all the files like .gitignore, readme, index1, with git bash, do the commits and push to github!.

Day 2. (8 of April 2022)
- Starting with styles, with a little color, get better structure, justify-content, separate the footer and I was doing a little thing about responsive design.

Day 3. (9 of April 2022)
- Today I start with the navegation inside the page.

Day 4. (10 of April 2022)
- I start to think about the content or info we going to have on the page. So I research and look another's blogs for ideas about the design, in this moment I have to be honest, I am not a designer, so I have to look for something beautiful and test if I liked.

Day 5. (11 of April 2022)
- The plan is to add the page images and animations, but I donÂ´t know completely how to do this, so, today, I was reviewing and learning more about this issue in the class of Platzi.

Day 6. (12 of April 2022)
- Today I was applying everything I learned, and how much I still have to learn about the images on the page. You can see that images were added so that they adapt to all screens and also that in this adaptation they do not pixelate, there is still a lot to learn but "display: flex" has become my best friend!

Day 7. (13 of April 2022)
- To be honest, it was a day of free time!
    Jeje No, I was trying to add one video and do all the css I know for this, the video doesn't reproduce, so tomorrow I go to fixed it!

Day 8. (14 of April 2022)
- The video is fixed! With controls and preload! This can be a little thing for you, but for me is something I am happy to learn!

Day 9. (22 of April 2022)
- Sometimes you need to stop, see all in perspective, and have an idea what is the things you like to do. 
- Also not all the time do you have to code, for a long time you have to study what is the thing you like to do in the code, so in the past few days, I was studying.
- Today I put in this repository the fonts, variables of size and color, one root in the CSS file, and also I think this going to do more easy future changes in the code.

Day 10. (1 of May 2022)
- After almost two weeks without knowing what to do, and with some medical indispositions. I have returned to the challenge, this time we are going to generate a contact form and suggestions for new places to visit.

Day 11. (3 of May 2022)
- Went you have to write code, find the images, think about design, write the post, it's a little complicated went you aren't a writer, a designer, or a programmer. But that is the challenge so on this day I writed my first post "Guatape".

Day 12. (4 of May 2022)
- Not all the things function, on the first try, so, but I wrote the post in Spanish, so on this day, I go to translate and also do the footer.

Day 13. (6 of May 2022)
- I write things about myself that I have in my mind, it's like a description of my self-discovery. And attached a link to the principal page to redirect the people who want to see it!

If you are here, please come one and see my portfolio!

Good day!

Paula A. Sosa Hdez.
